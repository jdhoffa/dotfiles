# Jackson Hoffart's Dotfiles

Forked from https://github.com/joshmedeski/dotfiles

This is the home of all my dotfiles. These are special files that add custom configurations to my computer and applications, primarily the terminnal.

# Known Bugs

- [ ] Configure copilot to work with Lunarvim
  - [ ] Copilot `tab` doesn't work for copilot
- [ ] `eval (/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)` can't be used in config.fish. My brew node install is prioritized over my fnm node verisons (which I want to be the highest priority in the $PATH). For now, I'm manually adding homebrew items to the path.

```fish
# TODO: figure out how to add this back (see above)
# eval (/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)
fish_add_path /opt/homebrew/bin
fish_add_path /opt/homebrew/sbin
```

# Recently Done

- [x] Convert Neovim to Lua with Luavim (lvim)
  - [x] Switch to native Neovim lsp
  - [ ] Merge my previous nvim-config with lvim's config.lua

# Wishlist

- [ ] Add additional keybindings for using Copilot
- [ ] When a pane is split, count the number of rows outputted by the previous command and resize it to that amount
- [ ] Bind <prefix> ? to display all keyboard shortcuts (including custom mappings). Create keymapping shortcut
- [ ] Extend `aw` to create custom Neovim theme (that matches Alacritty theme)
- [ ] Learn targets.vim https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/blog/exploring-vim-plugins-improve-and-extend-your-text-objects-with-targets-vim
- [ ] Bind <space>lf to popup lf and bind `e` to edit in existing neovim instance (using neovim remote?)
- [ ] Setup Obsidian / vimwiki setup

## Done

- [x] Have neovim auto run `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf` when `~/.tmux.conf` is saved (create vim plugin)
- [x] Tell neovim to automatically run `brew services restart yabai` when `~/.yabairc` is saved (in tmux split)
